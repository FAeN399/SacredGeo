# History and Goals

## History

The Advanced Sacred Geometry project began as a passion for exploring the ancient principles of sacred geometry through modern computational tools. Inspired by historical texts and ancient architecture, the library was developed to:
- **Document Ancient Wisdom:** Collate and reinterpret traditional geometric forms like the Flower of Life, Merkaba, and Platonic solids.
- **Bridge Traditions and Technology:** Provide a programmatic approach to study and visualize shapes that have held spiritual significance across cultures.
- **Revitalize Historical Concepts:** Revisit age-old concepts such as the Golden Ratio and dual polyhedra, offering a fresh perspective through interactive visualizations and animations.

Throughout its evolution, this project has integrated both artistic inspiration and rigorous mathematical structure, paving the way for innovative applications in art, architecture, and scientific visualization.

## Goals

The primary goals of the Advanced Sacred Geometry library are:

- **Educational Outreach:** To serve as an educational resource for students, artists, and researchers interested in the mathematical beauty and mysticism of sacred geometry.
- **Interactive Exploration:** To offer tools that allow users to engage interactively with complex geometric forms, deepening their understanding of symmetry, fractals, and proportions.
- **Creative Expression:** To inspire creative projects by providing a framework for generating custom sacred geometry compositions, mandalas, and fractal patterns.
- **Interdisciplinary Applications:** To explore potential applications of sacred geometry in fields such as molecular design, acoustics, architecture, and beyond.
- **Community Building:** To establish a community of practitioners where knowledge, techniques, and artistic expressions in sacred geometry are shared and expanded upon.

As the project evolves, we aim to include even more comprehensive guides, extended animations, and collaborative tools that further bridge ancient knowledge with modern technology.
