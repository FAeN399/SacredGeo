    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've explored several advanced sacred geometry shapes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Merkaba (Star Tetrahedron)** - Two interpenetrating tetrahedra forming a star-like shape\n",
    "2. **Vector Equilibrium (Cuboctahedron)** - An Archimedean solid with perfect equilibrium of forces\n",
    "3. **Platonic Solids** - The five regular polyhedra fundamental to sacred geometry\n",
    "4. **Torus** - A donut-shaped surface with fascinating geometric properties\n",
    "5. **Metatron's Cube** - A complex 2D pattern containing projections of the Platonic solids\n",
    "\n",
    "These shapes form the foundation of sacred geometry and have applications in various fields including art, architecture, meditation, and theoretical physics. Our library provides tools to generate, visualize, and manipulate these shapes programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To further explore sacred geometry, consider:\n",
    "- Implementing more complex patterns like the Sri Yantra\n",
    "- Creating interactive visualizations where users can manipulate shapes\n",
    "- Exploring the relationships between different sacred geometry forms\n",
    "- Adding animation capabilities to show transformations between shapes"
